# Encryptix

Welcome to the **Encryptix** internship repository. This repository contains three data science projects completed as part of the internship tasks. Each project focuses on building and evaluating machine learning models for different real-world datasets. Below is a brief overview of each task.

## Titanic Survival Prediction

**Objective:**  
Use the Titanic dataset to build a model that predicts whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not.

**Dataset Overview:**  
The dataset includes information about individual passengers, such as their age, gender, ticket class, fare, cabin, and survival status.

**Key Steps:**
- Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values and encode categorical features.
- Model Training: Train a classification model to predict survival status.
- Evaluation: Evaluate model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and other relevant metrics.

## Iris Flower Classification

**Objective:**  
Use the Iris dataset to develop a model that classifies Iris flowers into three species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica.

**Dataset Overview:**  
The dataset includes measurements of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width for three species of Iris flowers.

**Key Steps:**
- Data Exploration: Visualize the data and understand feature distribution.
- Model Training: Train a classification model to predict the species of Iris flowers.
- Evaluation: Assess model accuracy and classification performance.

## Credit Card Fraud Detection

**Objective:**  
Build a machine learning model to identify fraudulent credit card transactions.

**Dataset Overview:**  
The dataset consists of credit card transactions labeled as fraudulent or genuine, with features preprocessed for confidentiality.

**Key Steps:**
- Data Preprocessing: Normalize transaction data, handle class imbalance, and split data into training/testing sets.
- Model Training: Train a classification model using algorithms like logistic regression or random forests.
- Evaluation: Evaluate performance using precision, recall, F1-score, and implement techniques to improve model results.
